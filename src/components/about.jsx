              <p>
                <b>Formal education has failed therapists.</b>
                <br />
                It's charged you an arm (and maybe a leg!) to teach you how to
                be a therapist, but utterly failed to teach you how to own and
                operate your own business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Well we want to change that. During our 6 week therapist
                bootcamp, we'll teach you everything you need to know to run
                your practice without worrying about money ever again, forever.
              </p>
              <p>
                That way, you're freed up to do what you do best -{" "}
