        <p>Disclaimer: No Earnings Projections, Promises Or Representations</p>

          You recognize and agree that we have made no implications, warranties,
          promises, suggestions, projections, representations or guarantees
          whatsoever to you about future prospects or earnings, or that you will

        <p>
          Any earnings or income statements, or any earnings or income examples,
          are only estimates of what we think you could earn. There is no
          assurance you will do as well as stated in any examples. If you rely
          upon any figures provided, you must accept the entire risk of not
          doing as well as the information provided. This applies whether the
          earnings or income examples are monetary in nature or pertain to
          advertising credits which may be earned (whether such credits are
          convertible to cash or not).

          There is no assurance that any prior successes or past results as to
          earnings or income (whether monetary or advertising credits, whether
          convertible to cash or not) will apply, nor can any prior successes be
          used, as an indication of your future success or results from any of
          the information, content, or strategies. Any and all claims or
          representations as to income or earnings (whether monetary or
          advertising credits, whether convertible to cash or not) are not to be
          considered as “average earnings”.

        <p>
          The economy, both where you do business, and on a national and even
          worldwide scale, creates additional uncertainty and economic risk. An
          economic recession or depression might negatively affect the results
          produced by Nathan Lee's products and/or services.

          get rich, that you will do as well, or that you will have any earnings
          (whether monetary or advertising credits, whether convertible to cash
          or not), at all.
